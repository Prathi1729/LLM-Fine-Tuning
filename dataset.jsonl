You must renew in person at a DMV office. You will need to complete a CDL application or bring in the DMV renewal notice mailed to you (cross out any old information and write in the current information). You must provide a residency document on every renewal. If renewing for the first time since May 10, 2017, provide BD/LP documents.

You will need to take the knowledge test(s) (if required). Your renewal notice will indicate if you need to take a knowledge test. You are allowed three attempts to pass each of the required knowledge tests. If you fail the same test three times, your application is no longer valid and you will need to reapply. If you are applying for a REAL ID, you must also provide proof of your identity and residency from the list of acceptable REAL ID documents.

To renew, you will need the nine-digit DMV ID number form your driver license, the last four digits of your social security number, your vision test results (submitted online by a vision test provider or a completed MV-619), and a credit card or pinless debit card."

Eligibility: You must meet specific eligibility requirements, including age, proof of identity and lawful presence, and residency.\n2. Knowledge and Skills Tests: Pass written knowledge tests and a driving skills test in a vehicle representative of the type you will operate. The tests verify your understanding of traffic laws and safe driving practices. You may provide evidence of having successfully passed a driving test administered by an authorized third party.\n3. Documentation: Provide the information required for the CDL, as specified by the state.\n4. Certifications: Certify that you are not subject to any disqualifications and do not have a driver's license from more than one state.\n5. Surrender Non-CDL: Surrender your non-CDL driver's licenses and CLP to the State.\n6.

        "Output": "The process for renewing an ID card and a commercial license with all endorsements and a noncommercial license with all endorsements differs.\nFor New York:\nYou can renew your non-driver ID card online. To renew, you will need your nine-digit DMV ID number from your driver license, the last four digits of your social security number, your vision test results (submitted online by a vision test provider or a completed MV-619), and a credit card or pinless debit card. You can renew your license up to one year before it expires or 2 years after. Your address on file with the DMV must be up to date. To renew your license, you\u2019ll need proof that you passed an eye test. If you have a Commercial Driver License (CDL), you will need to renew at a DMV Office. You can\u2019t renew a learner permit or a license that is suspended or revoked or a non-driver ID card that expired for more than 2 years. The fee is on your renewal notice and displayed on your computer screen when you renew online. You can also check the non-driver ID card renewal fee chart.\nFor California:\nIf you are a commercial driver and your CDL has been expired for over two years, you\u2019ll need to take a skills test for the type of commercial motor vehicle you will be driving to renew your license. To better prepare yourself for the skills test, visit the California Commercial Driver\u2019s Handbook (PDF). To renew your CDL in person, complete a CDL Application or bring in the DMV renewal notice mailed to you (cross out any old information and write in the current information). Visit a DMV office, where you will provide a residency document on every renewal and BD/LP documents if renewing for the first time since May 10, 2017. Submit a completed 10 Year History Record Check (DL 939) (PDF) (if you\u2019ve been issued a DL of any kind in another state or jurisdiction in the last 10 years), have your thumbprint scanned, pass a vision exam, have your photo taken, and pay the nonrefundable application fee (application and fee valid for 12 months). Take the knowledge test(s) (if required). Your renewal notice will indicate if you need to take a knowledge test. You are allowed three attempts to pass each of the required knowledge tests. If you fail the same test three times, your application is no longer valid and you will need to reapply. When you apply for a REAL ID in person, you must also provide proof of your identity and residency from the list of acceptable REAL ID documents. After you complete these requirements, we will issue you a temporary DL until you receive your new license in the mail. The temporary license is valid for 60 days. You will receive your DL via mail within three to four weeks.\nFor Washington:\nBefore you get started, make sure your home address is current. If it has changed, update your address with us before you renew. You'll need a Visa, MasterCard, or American Express (a 3% card payment fee applies) or bank account information (no added fees). Get ready to print your temporary and know that your temporary won't include your photo, and you can't use it for identification. Have all your information ready to enter: full name, date of birth, driver license or ID card number, Social Security number (if applicable), and residential address (you must log in or create an account to change your address). We use the last photo we took. If you want a new photo, you'll need to visit a driver licensing office. You should receive it in 2-4 weeks. You can renew up to 1 year before your license expires (it usually expires on your birthday), or up to 8 years after the expiration date Note: If your license expired less than 60 days before the day you renew it, we won't charge a late fee. If your license expired more than 60 days ago, there's an extra $10 fee to renew. If it expired 8 years ago, you can't renew and will need to start over."

To get a free replacement for a license or learner permit that was stolen or lost due to a crime, you must obtain Form MV-78B from a police agency and submit it with your application.\nTo replace online (Standard, REAL ID, or Enhanced), confirm your current address on file is correct, visit the \"Replace Online Now\" link on the DMV website, submit the necessary information, and pay the $17.50 fee by credit/debit card. To replace by mail or in person, use the Application for Permit, Driver License or Non-Driver ID Card (MV-44).

Once you receive your replacement card, your old card is no longer valid. If you find the old card, destroy it. In New York, to get a free replacement for a license or learner permit that was stolen or lost due to a crime, you must obtain Form MV-78B from a police agency. This form is not available from the DMV and must be submitted with your application. If you have a Standard document and want to replace it by upgrading to a REAL ID or Enhanced ID, you must apply in person and bring: 1. Your current 'Standard' New York State license (unless you lost it). 2. A completed MV-44 form. 3.

        "Output": "The California DMV verifies information on a driver's license or identification card application using several methods. They set eligibility requirements such as minimum age, proof of identity and lawful presence, residency documentation, and vision standards. Written knowledge tests and road skills tests are used to verify that applicants understand traffic laws, signage, and safe driving practices. To verify veteran status for the \"VETERAN\" designation on a license, the DMV requires a signed verification form from a county veterans service office. In New York, the DMV primarily relies on in-person verification of original documents, though they also use electronic verification with insurance companies to confirm coverage and lift suspensions."

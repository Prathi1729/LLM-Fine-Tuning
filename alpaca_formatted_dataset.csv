You must provide a residency document on every renewal. If renewing for the first time since May 10, 2017, provide BD/LP documents. Submit a completed 10 Year History Record Check (DL 939) if you’ve been issued a DL of any kind in another state or jurisdiction in the last 10 years. You will have your thumbprint scanned, pass a vision exam, have your photo taken, and pay the nonrefundable application fee (application and fee valid for 12 months). You will need to take the knowledge test(s) (if required). Your renewal notice will indicate if you need to take a knowledge test. You are allowed three attempts to pass each of the required knowledge tests. If you fail the same test three times, your application is no longer valid and you will need to reapply. If you are applying for a REAL ID, you must also provide proof of your identity and residency from the list of acceptable REAL ID documents. After you complete these requirements, DMV will issue you a temporary DL valid for 60 days until you receive your new license in the mail within three to four weeks.

Each state has its own specific criteria, including age restrictions, knowledge and skills tests, vision and medical requirements, and documentation needed.
However, I can offer some general information based on the provided contexts:
Commercial Driver's License (CDL):
*   Minimum age and specific requirements depend on the state.
*   You must have a CDL if you drive a vehicle with a GVWR of more than 26,000 pounds, or a GCWR of more than 26,000 pounds including a towed unit with a GVWR of more than 10,000 pounds, or is made to carry 15 or more persons, or carries hazardous materials.
*   It is illegal to hold more than one CDL at a time.
Non-Commercial Driver's License:
*   Minimum age and specific requirements depend on the state.
*   Authorizes drivers to operate specific types of motor vehicles.
*   In California, there are sub-types of licenses that authorize drivers to operate specific types of motor vehicles, such as a standard vehicle or truck for personal use, a motorcycle, a travel trailer/fifth wheel, or a housecar/motorhome.

If you replace more than 40 days before your 21st birthday, the license will still display ""UNDER 21."" If you replace fewer than 40 days before your 21st birthday, the license will not display ""UNDER 21."" If your document has a ""Temporary Visitor"" status indicator, you must replace it in person at a DMV office. You cannot replace it online or by mail.

Some states have laws that restrict or prohibit licensing for certain offenses, while others provide a process for individuals to demonstrate rehabilitation and eligibility for licensure."
How does the DMV verify the information provided on a certification or occupational license application?,"The DMV verifies information on applications by checking submitted documents against various databases and records. They confirm the authenticity and validity of documents such as birth certificates, social security cards, and other forms of identification. The DMV also cross-references information with other state and federal agencies to ensure accuracy and prevent fraud. For veteran status verification in California, the Department of Veterans Affairs, in consultation with the Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Association of County Veterans Service Officers, developed a verification form. A county veterans service office verifies the veteran’s status, signs the form, and returns it to the veteran, who then presents it to the DMV."

Are there any additional requirements for replacing a lost or stolen certification or occupational license?,"In California, if your driver's license is lost, destroyed, or mutilated, you must provide satisfactory proof of the loss, destruction, or mutilation to the Department of Motor Vehicles to obtain a duplicate. If the licensee is a minor, evidence of permission to obtain a duplicate from their parents, guardian, or person having custody of the minor is also required.
In Texas, if a driver's license or certificate issued under the Transportation Code is lost or destroyed, the person to whom it was issued may obtain a duplicate. An applicant for a corrected driver's license or certificate must submit to the department the required fee, accompanied by the required information that has changed with proof satisfactory to the department that supports the change.
In Washington, to replace a lost or stolen driver's license by mail, you must send a completed Driver License Renewal/Replacement Request While Out-of-State form and any supporting documents required for license restrictions, such as a Visual Examination Report or Physical Examination Report signed by a licensed medical provider."
What is the purpose of the fingerprinting requirement for occupational licenses?,"I cannot provide information on the purpose of fingerprinting requirements for occupational licenses, as the provided context focuses on driver's licenses and commercial driver's licenses, not occupational licenses."
How does the DMV use the information obtained through fingerprinting?,"In Texas, the DMV uses fingerprint information, specifically thumbprints or index fingerprints if thumbprints cannot be taken, as part of its image verification system. This system, along with facial image, is used to:
1.  Ensure that an applicant is issued only one original license, permit, or certificate.
2.  Prevent applicants from fraudulently obtaining a duplicate license, permit, or certificate.
3.  Prevent other fraud related to license, permit, or certificate applications.
Additionally, the image verification system can be used to aid other law enforcement agencies in:
1.  Establishing the identity of a victim of a disaster or crime that a local law enforcement agency is unable to establish.
2.  Conducting an investigation of criminal conduct."
What is the process for obtaining a fingerprinted original application?,"In Texas, to obtain a fingerprinted original application for a driver's license, you must include your thumbprints (or index fingerprints if thumbprints cannot be taken) on the application.

How long does it take to process a fingerprinted original application?,The provided documents do not contain information about the processing time for a fingerprinted original application.
What is the criteria for determining the eligibility of an individual for an occupational license?,"In Texas, a person is eligible to apply for an occupational driver's license if their license has been suspended, revoked, or canceled for a cause other than a physical or mental disability or impairment, or a determination by the department that the person is incapable of safely operating a motor vehicle. Also, a person is eligible if they do not hold a driver's license and are ineligible to obtain one because of a suspension order, or if they are ineligible because they hold a driver's license issued by another state or country that was suspended, revoked, or canceled for a cause other than a physical or mental disability or impairment. To get an occupational license, a judge must determine the person has an essential need to operate a motor vehicle.

A county or municipality that provides services under an agreement described by Section 521.009 may collect an additional fee of up to $5 for each transaction provided that relates to driver's license and personal identification certificate services only.
In California, penalties are determined by adding a percentage of the vehicle license fee, plus a registration late fee, plus a California Highway Patrol (CHP) late fee.

Maryland:
For high-risk drivers—such as those with serious violations or repeated offenses—the state may require proof of financial responsibility through an SR-22 or similar filing by the insurance company. Driving under suspension, driving without insurance, or accumulating too many demerit points can trigger enforcement actions managed by the DMV.
Texas:
An application for an original driver's license must be accompanied by evidence of financial responsibility or a statement that the applicant does not own a motor vehicle for which evidence of financial responsibility is required under Chapter 601. The department may require an application for a renewal of a driver's license to be accompanied by evidence of financial responsibility or a statement that the applicant does not own a motor vehicle for which evidence of financial responsibility is required under Chapter 601.

Can an individual obtain a standard ID card or certification if they have a criminal record?,"Whether an individual with a criminal record can obtain a standard ID card or certification depends on the specific laws and regulations of the state in question.
In California, according to Vehicle Code section 12801.9, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) shall issue an identification card to a person who is unable to submit satisfactory proof that the applicant’s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law if the person provides satisfactory proof to the department of the person’s identity and California residency. The law does not explicitly deny an ID card or certification based solely on an individual's criminal record. The DMV may require the applicant to provide documentation to verify their identity and residency.
In Texas, according to Transportation Code section 521.142, an applicant for an original license must state the applicant's full name and place and date of birth. This information must be verified by presentation of proof of identity satisfactory to the department. The department must accept as satisfactory proof of identity under this subsection an offender identification card or similar form of identification issued to an inmate by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice if the applicant also provides supplemental verifiable records or documents that aid in establishing identity."
How does the DMV verify the information provided on a standard ID card or certification application?,"The California DMV verifies the information provided on a standard ID card or driver's license application by requiring applicants to submit documents proving their identity and residency. The DMV may conduct a secondary review if the documents are insufficient. For those requesting ""Veteran"" printed on their card, the California Department of Veterans Affairs, in consultation with the DMV and the California Association of County Veterans Service Officers, developed a verification form. A county veterans service office must verify the applicant's veteran status, sign the form, and return it to the applicant, who then submits it to the DMV. The DMV also verifies social security numbers electronically with the Social Security Administration."
What is the process for reporting a lost or stolen standard ID card or certification?,"In California, if your driver’s license is lost or stolen, you must furnish satisfactory proof of the loss to the Department of Motor Vehicles to obtain a duplicate.

A person in possession of a valid driver’s license who has been informed either by the department or by a law enforcement agency that the document is mutilated must surrender the license to the department not later than 10 days after that notification. In New York, to get a free replacement for a license or learner permit that was stolen or lost due to a crime, you must obtain Form MV-78B from a police agency and submit it with your application. In Florida, if there is a name change, driver license or ID card holders must update their name with the Social Security Administration prior to updating their name on the credential, and they must present an original or certified court order of marriage certificate when applying to change the name on their driver license or ID card."

If you are adding an endorsement, but not upgrading to a higher classification, DMV will waive all knowledge and endorsement tests completed or waived on the previous application, including HazMat, if the new application is started within 12 months of the previous renewal date or original CDL issue date.
CDL knowledge tests include:

They set eligibility requirements such as minimum age, proof of identity and lawful presence, residency documentation, and vision standards. Written knowledge tests and road skills tests are used to verify that applicants understand traffic laws, signage, and safe driving practices. To verify veteran status for the ""VETERAN"" designation on a license, the DMV requires a signed verification form from a county veterans service office. In New York, the DMV primarily relies on in-person verification of original documents, though they also use electronic verification with insurance companies to confirm coverage and lift suspensions."

What is the purpose of the driving school instructor license?,"The purpose of the driving school instructor license is to ensure that individuals providing driver education and training meet specific qualifications and standards set by the state. This includes knowledge of traffic laws, road safety, and effective teaching methods. In California, a licensed or certified driving instructor must sign the instruction permit of a student under 18 after at least one hour of behind-the-wheel training. In Washington, a qualified teacher of driver training education must be certificated and obtain a traffic safety endorsement or a letter of approval from the superintendent of public instruction."
Is the driving school instructor license subject to change?,"Whether a driving school instructor license is subject to change depends on the state.
In Washington state, qualified teachers of driver training education must meet continuing traffic safety education requirements established by the superintendent of public instruction.
In California, an integrated driver education and training program must be approved by the department and conducted by a driving instructor licensed under Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 11100) of Division 5.

You may still qualify for assistance with your fee even if you feel there are other factors to consider in determining your eligibility."

Military Knowledge Test Waiver:
For current or former military service members, a state may waive the requirement to pass a knowledge test for a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP) or Commercial Driver's License (CDL) if the applicant meets specific conditions.

Military Skills Test Waiver:
A state may waive the requirement for military service members to pass a driving skills test or specialized knowledge test for a passenger (P) endorsement, knowledge test for a tank vehicle (N) endorsement, or knowledge test for a hazardous materials (H) endorsement, if the applicant meets certain conditions. They must certify and provide evidence that, in the year before applying, they were regularly employed in a military position requiring operation of a passenger CMV (for a passenger endorsement waiver), operation of a tank vehicle (for a tank vehicle endorsement waiver), or transportation of hazardous materials (for a hazardous materials endorsement waiver). They must also meet the same criteria regarding licenses, convictions, and traffic violations as mentioned above for the knowledge test waiver.
DUI Hearing Fee Waiver:
In some states, such as Washington, you can apply for a waiver of the DUI hearing fee if you are indigent. To do so, you must submit a Request for DUI Hearing form, a DUI Administrative Hearing Fee Waiver Application, and, if needed, an Additional Eligibility Determination form.

You may still qualify for assistance with your fee even if you feel there are other factors to consider in determining your eligibility."

Can an individual hold multiple waivers?,"Yes, an individual may hold multiple waivers for CDL requirements, specifically regarding knowledge and skills tests, provided they meet all conditions and limitations for each waiver.

These conditions include specific employment in a relevant military position, a clean driving record, and other stipulations."
